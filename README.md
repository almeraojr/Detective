# Detective

This project is a partial requirement for grade in Distributed Systems course at the State University of Rio Grande do Sul - UERGS. Was set up in late 2020 under the supervision of Professor Débora Matos, Ph.D.
We're undergrad students of Computer Engineering at UERGS, rated as the best Computer Engineering in Brazil.

As they say:

## Description
We are developing a Detective game in Java. The game is pretty simple, but we wiil be allowed to show some of the distributed systems characteristics, such as client/server model.

First of all, our game will be a Multicast between clients and server using some of the concepts that we learn in this course, such as Multithreading, sockets and of course the client/server model.

Also, we will use threads to allow us to create a better experience for our players, because they bring to us an asynchronous process experience
